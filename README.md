### our workflow:
we created a log in, people can sign in from there (for now there is a default user in case no one signed in- username- Admin@gmail.com, password- a1234567). if they want to sign in they can do it in sign up, which is split into fragments.
username must be an email- be of pattern letters@letters.letters. password must contain between 8-20 characters, at least one digit, one letter.
must put in a name- first and last which are letters only.
and must put a profile photo- from gallery or camera.
after signing up hes transferred to login for logging in.
after log in hes passed to the apps feed, containing 10 json posts, each post contains a photo, a name of the poster, and a description.
he can add a post by pressing the plus button (top, third from left), and then he must choose a photo from gallery or camera, and write a description.
he can get to menu (three stripes) to see hes contact, move to dark mode, or log out.
he can comment on a post by pressing the comment button, then he can see previous comments or post new ones, plus he can like\edit\delete them.
he can like the post or "share" (doesn't share yet).
he can edit or delete the posts.
he can press on the  search icon which will open a place to input search (the search isn't implemented yet).
